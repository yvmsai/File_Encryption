Steps to execute the code:
1) First need to open two terminal sessions, one for client and one for server.
2) IN next step, Server need to run in one terminal by using below command in specified
path.
> python3 TCP_Server.py
3) Next, in another terminal, need to run client terminal by using command in specified
path,
>python3 TCP_client.py
4) Before running Client, need to ensure Server is up and running. Once server is up and
running, execute client.
5) Once client is executed, ensure socket is established with the client IP address displayed
at server terminal.
6) Once socket is established and tried to use the terminal interface and following the

perform.
7) If you want to update directly in initial step, need to sure that the file is available or not,
if file is not available then it throws file not found.
